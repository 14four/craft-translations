## Translations Overview

**Launch multilingual Craft 3 content fast** Eliminate error-prone and cumbersome copy/paste processes. Simply select entries or globals, target languages, submit for translation and receive translations back into Craft 3 for review and publishing.

**Work with any translator** Use your own translators or language service provider? No problem. The plugin’s export/import feature makes it easy to work with independent translators or a translation agency. When using the export/import translation option, you'll be able to export your site content as XML files that can then be re-imported once translated.

**Fully automated translation workflow** If you need high quality translations and prefer to have entries and globals translated and synced with your Craft install, select the Acclaro service option in the Translators tab. Acclaro uses [human in-country linguists](https://www.acclaro.com/services/?utm_campaign=Craft%20Plugin%20Store&utm_source=Craft%20Plugin%20Store%20Listing%20-%20Human%20Translation%20Services&utm_medium=Listing) and a dedicated project manager to ensure the success of your multilingual Craft 3 website.

**3rd party plugin support** Includes translation support for Neo, Linkit, SEOmatic, Redactor and Supertable. Use additional 3rd party plugins that need translating?
